# Deploy UnieMax frontend to PROD

Follow the runbook in [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](../../../docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)
(section "Production site") — it is the single source of truth. Key facts:

- **Prod is frontend-only.** It serves its own build from `/var/www/uniemax-prod`
  but shares the SAME backend (pm2 `uniemax-backend`, port 4000) as dev.
  `/deploy_prod` must NEVER touch the backend, pm2, or Prisma. In particular it
  must never run `db:deploy` — schema changes ship through `/deploy_dev`.
- Prod URLs: `https://uniemax.com/` and `https://www.uniemax.com/` (+ `/admin`),
  direct port `http://13.206.249.204:8081/` (needs TCP 8081 inbound in the
  security group). Served by nginx vhosts `uniemax-com` (domain, HTTPS via the
  `uniemax.com` certbot cert) and `uniemax-prod` (port 8081), both rooted at
  `/var/www/uniemax-prod`.
- **`uniemax.zontechx.com` is retired** — that vhost no longer exists. If you
  see it referenced anywhere, it is stale.
- Dev (`/deploy_dev`) and prod deploy from the same clone `~/uniemax`; prod only
  updates when this skill runs, so it can lag behind dev intentionally.
- The prod frontend has no `.env` of its own: `VITE_API_URL` stays unset so the
  build calls `/api/...` same-origin, which each vhost proxies to `:4000`.

## Flow

1. **Pre-flight (local):** `git fetch` + `git status -sb` — local `main` must be
   pushed. Stop and tell the user if there are unpushed commits.
2. **SSH:** `plink -batch` with the pinned host key exactly as in
   DEPLOYMENT.md → "Server". Windows OpenSSH does not work with this server.
3. **On the server** (`~/uniemax`):
   - `git fetch` and show incoming commits; `git pull`.
   - `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund` from the repo **ROOT only** (npm workspace —
     running it inside `frontend/` or `backend/` breaks the other app), and only
     if `package-lock.json` changed.
   - `cd ~/uniemax/frontend && npm run build`
   - `sudo rm -rf /var/www/uniemax-prod/* && sudo cp -r dist/* /var/www/uniemax-prod/`
   - Note: this pull also updates the working tree that dev builds from; that is
     fine — dev's deployed files in `/var/www/uniemax` are not touched.
4. **Verify (never skip):** on the server curl `http://127.0.0.1:8081/`,
   `/admin`, `/api/v1/public/stores` → all 200; then from the local machine
   check `https://uniemax.com/` (+ `/admin`). The `/admin` check matters — it
   is a second SPA (`admin.html`) and depends on the vhost's `^~ /admin/`
   fallback, so confirm it returns the admin bundle, not the storefront.
5. **Report:** deployed commit hash + verification results. Explicitly remind
   that the backend was NOT redeployed (use `/deploy_dev` for backend changes —
   backend changes affect BOTH dev and prod since they share it).

If anything fails, do not leave prod half-deployed — the old build was deleted
before copy, so re-run the copy from `frontend/dist` after fixing. If
DEPLOYMENT.md and reality disagree, trust the server, then update DEPLOYMENT.md.
